            The Virtual assistant can help the retailer like Jabong Flipkart and Amazon detect and forecast fashion trends and target marketing a campingâ€™s.
            Retailer has hired you to build a virtual stylist assistant that looks a Instagram and Facebook images and Classifies the ongoing trends and this story we're going to use the fashionmnist data. It's a data set that contains images of bags shoes and dresses. And we're asking the deep network to classify the images into 10 classes.
            So we wanted to build kind of an app per se or a model. They can look at images and can tell us exactly what category in this image. 
            Is it like a short. Is it a bag. Is it like a hat. And so on.
            That's the whole objective.
            The data again they are divided into 28 by 28 greyscale images and the target class is actually No. 1 out of 10 which is kind of a target label which can be categorized as you can see into either like maybe a shoe maybe like like pants. Basically these are the target classes. 
            We have the t shirts trousers pullovers ankle boots sneakers and so on so forth.
